    "- An (infinitely long) **tape**, divided into discrete cells. \n",
    "    * Each cell contains a single symbol from a finite alphabet, e.g., the set $\\{0, 1\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **head** which can be positioned over a single cell on the tape.\n",
    "    * At each timestep, the head reads the current symbol, writes a new symbol to the current cell, and then either moves 1 cell to the left, moves one cell to the right, or halts.\n",

    "- A **register** that stores the current internal state of the machine. \n",

    "## Example: Identifying Palindromes\n",
    "One simple Turing machine program is the program which identifies whether a binary string is a palindrome. For our purposes, a palindrome is defined as an input for which the first half is a \"mirror image\" of the second half. For example, a string like \"ABBA\" is a palindrome, while \"ABAB\" is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input tape\n",
    "We will provide input to the TM in the form of a Python `list` of symbols from our alphabet, where each element in the list represents a different cell on the tape. We use a special symbol, $*$, to indicate the end of our input. In the following program, we assume that our alphabet consists only of symbols in the set $\\{A, B, *\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
