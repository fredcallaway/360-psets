    "All Princeton students pledge to adhere to the Honor Code in the conduct of all written examinations, tests, and quizzes that take place in class. However, much of your work at Princeton — from papers to problem sets to the senior thesis — will be produced outside of class, whether in the library, your dorm room, or elsewhere. Such work is governed by the University's academic regulations, which are designed to ensure the integrity of your academic work. These regulations fall under the jurisdiction not of the Honor Committee, but of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. This [booklet](https://odoc.princeton.edu/sites/odoc/files/950045_AcademicIntegrity2018-19_FINAL_PDF.pdf) provides information about Princeton's academic regulations and how you can safeguard the integrity of your original work."

    "However, the instructors reserve the right to deduct points if your code does not conform to the spirit of the problem. For example, if we ask you to write code to compute the sum of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, we expect a solution like `answer = np.sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, NOT `answer = 15`. The reason for this is that if you just supply us with a number, we cannot determine how you got that number: just like in a math class where you need to show your work, we want to see all the code you used to find the solution."
